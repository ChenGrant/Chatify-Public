Description: Chatify is a web messaging app that allows for instant messaging, sharing of photos, videos, and other files for group chats. Users log in using a Google account, and authentication is managed using Google Firebase authentication. Once authenticated, users can create group chats to add other users and message them. Many files are supported for sending such as word, png, mp4, ico, etc. Users can see when other users are typing and can also see which users have seen which messages. To the right of a group chat, users can see all members within the group chat and their activity status, all the photos that were sent, and an option to delete a group chat. This website is hosted using Heroku.
